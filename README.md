# About

This is a university project that was developed for a business client. The project has been modified so that it cannot be identified to whom or for what purpose it was made. The product data is generated with [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

You can search or sort users and product info, but you can't edit or delete users. This is a "dummy" application.

You can test the app at https://annikajoever.github.io/uni-client-app/.
